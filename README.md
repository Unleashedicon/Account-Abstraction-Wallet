<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# üìñ Account Abstraction<a name="about-project"></a>

This project aims to demonstrate proficiency in Solidity with a focus on Account Abstraction by designing a smart contract wallet for users. Unlike traditional wallets, this solution creates a smart contract wallet (not an Externally Owned Account, or EOA) for each user, facilitating advanced wallet operations. The project includes the development of Solidity contracts for wallet creation and operations, leveraging EIP-4337 to structure user operations, and a front-end interface to interact with the smart contract.

## üõ† Built With <a name="built-with"></a>

### Tech Stack <a name="tech-stack"></a>
This Eccomerce DApp is built using the following technologies and libraries:

- **Solidity:** The programming language used for developing Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Hardhat** It is a development environment for Ethereum smart contracts, providing a flexible, efficient, and extensible toolkit for building and testing decentralized applications.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** The programming language employed for crafting the application's logic.
- **Git:** A version control system for tracking changes in the codebase and facilitating collaboration.
- **GitHub**: A web-based platform for hosting the project's Git repository and enabling code sharing and collaboration.
- **npm:** The package manager for installing and managing project dependencies.
- **VS Code:** A popular code editor with excellent support for JavaScript and React development.
<!-- Features -->

### Key Features <a name="key-features"></a>

1. **Smart Contract Wallet Creation**

- Automatically create a unique smart contract wallet for each user who opts to ‚ÄúCreate a Wallet.‚Äù
- Ensure that each wallet is distinct and isolated, providing secure and independent storage and transaction capabilities.
2. **Funds Transfer**

- Enable users to send and receive cryptocurrency using their smart contract wallet.
- Implement secure and efficient methods to handle transactions between wallets, ensuring reliability and integrity of transfers.
3. **Wallet Balance Viewing**

- Provide users with the ability to view the balance of their smart contract wallet.
- Implement functions to fetch and display wallet balances accurately.
4. **User Operations Structs (EIP-4337)**

- Utilize the reference of EIP-4337 to create new structs that facilitate and manage user operations within the wallet.
- Ensure compliance with EIP-4337 standards to enhance the interoperability and functionality of the wallet.
5. **Front-End Interface**

- Develop a simple and intuitive front-end page where users can interact with their wallet.
- Include features such as balance viewing and transaction history on the front-end interface.
- Use modern web technologies to ensure a responsive and user-friendly experience.
6. **Testnet Deployment**

- Deploy the smart contract wallets on a Testnet for testing and demonstration purposes.
- Conduct thorough testing to ensure the functionality, security, and reliability of the smart contract wallet system.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## üíª Installation and setup <a name="getting-started"></a>


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
